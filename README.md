# Employee Directory

[Click here](https://iskona.github.io/React-Employee-Directory/) to launch this project on GitHub Pages.

## Overview:
This is a simple employee directory app with React. Upon load, it fakes an employee directory by importing a list of people from randomuser.me. Once on the page, the user is able to search by first name, last name, or email address to find the person they're looking for. The list of employees renders dynamically as you type, helping the user narrow down their search. The information about the employees provided to the user include a profile image, phone number, email, and date of birth.

## Built with:

* React
* Moment
* randomuser.me

## User Story:

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
